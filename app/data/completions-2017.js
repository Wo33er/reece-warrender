        review: "Both technically and stylistically gorgeous with an attention to detail of both the world and the character animations that the story is portrayed elegantly without even a word. The gameplay gets repetitive before long but thanks to its short nature and mysterious unraveling tale it's more than captivating until it's impressively haunting conclusion."

        rating: "4.5",
        review: "The pretty aesthetics lured me in along with a hefty 85% price cut, though below the surface there's little depth with simplistic puzzles, a heavily linear world and a tedious existential narrative driven story. It's not a game I'd go out of my way to recommend, especially at a time where there are so many strong alternatives like The Witness."

        review: "DOOM is a stunning faithful adaptation of the original genre defining masterpiece brought into the modern era, to a comparable degree as Metroid Prime was to Super Metroid. The gunplay is absolute bliss, arguably the best I've experienced, with a flawlessly implemented melee gameplay loop that fits like it was always meant to be a part of the series. Fantastic, frantic and fluid from start to end."

        review: "I've waited at length for a reason to play Half Life again for the longest time, eagerly awaiting Black Mesa. Unfortunately whilst it's a great remake on paper the game itself corrupted my saves multiple times, and the tired gameplay and awkward pacing hasn't aged nearly as well as I'd hoped. Managed to drag myself through the later half of the game, and can only hope my desire to play Half Life 2 through against isn't as disappointing."

        review: "I'd like to just draw comparisons to it being Journey underwater, but that'd be too lofty a compliment. Its presentation is stunning throughout but greatly lacks the depth and emotional engagement that Journey posses. A lot of this comes from it being a solo adventure, but also because the silent tale isn't half as impactful a... journey."

        review: "Beautifully creative horror game that has you witness the terrors of normality through the eyes of a baby. Unfortunately creativity aside the game falls short in both horror and enough gameplay depth to remain engaging for its short timespan. The novelty runs dry pretty quickly, and the games pivot beyond normality only proceeds to drag it down."

        rating: "8",
        review: "After multiple attempts I finally worked my way through this heavily praised RPG classic. Whilst not a fan of JRPG games in general, there's a charm and accessibility to Chrono Trigger that made it easy to stick with. The combat system, thankfully avoiding excessive RNG, is great and is coupled with fantastic character development and intertwined story."
