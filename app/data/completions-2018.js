    {title: "Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube",date: "4th Jan",duration: "12",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Accidentally bought the wrong game, intending to get 'Q.U.B.E.' (they even look alike). Whilst I enjoyed the puzzle premise, it unfortunately all becomes a little repetitive and drawn out before long, and a little too easy to offer any real sense of challenge or accomplishment for a puzzle game of its kind."},
    {title: "Snipperclips",date: "6th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "A surprisingly charming cute character cutting puzzler that works especially well in co-op, though prepare to be cut to bits constantly if you choose to play with a maniac child like I did. Well worth the affordable price tag and a well tailored first experience for the Switch perfect in short bursts or on the go."},
    {title: "Doki Doki Literature Club!",date: "12th Jan",duration: "4.2",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "There's not a great deal that can be said without spoiling the game's primary hook, though it's safe to say that the experience begins with a content trigger warning and quickly extends far beyond its presented bounds. An enjoyable if wildly strange visual novel that attempts something unique and sticks the landing."},
    {title: "Hitman (2016)",date: "13th Jan",duration: "8.1",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "The reboot executes on its stealth sandbox approach so very successfully. Levels are intricate labyrinths of options and approaches, allowing you to truly feel like you're the assassin executing the play by play with the flexibility and freedom that should be afforded to you. Sad I missed the episodic releases but glad I gave the series another chance after Absolution left such a sour taste."},
    {title: "Tomb Raider (2013)",date: "14th Jan",duration: "12.1",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Take a dash of Uncharted, loosen the set pieces a little and add a smattering of torture porn by throwing Lara off an unreasonable amount of cliff edges and you've got a surprisingly well executed reboot to the Tomb Raider series. There's ample room for improvement, but there's potential for something special, so I'm hopeful in future installments to come."},
    {title: "Oxenfree",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5.9",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "The game starts off with an intriguing premise, but ultimately lost my interest around the half way mark due to the snail's pace at which the game proceeds, not aided by lengthy slow, plodding world backtracking, whilst the story and character development never quite achieves the payoff it attempts to build itself up-to."},
    {title: "Hidden Folks",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "A black and white Where's Wally/Waldo (depending where you come from), with an array of hidden object challenges to find in highly populated backgrounds. Fun enough, though a little repetitive before long and a good portion of the challenges aren't clear between the brief descriptions and the similar shared styles."},
    {title: "The Red Strings Club",date: "23rd Jan",duration: "3.8",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "An overwhelmingly stylish and elegantly put together cyberpunk adventure game though a little on the short side at around four hours long. Especially enjoyed the bar-tending segments, which creatively mix up the games otherwise linear adventure segments. I strangely want to play a straight bar-tending simulation game now."},
    {title: "Little Inferno",date: "24th Jan",duration: "3.1",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "Initially had high hopes between being well praised in reviews and from half of the team behind World of Goo, however, I found that the game fell short of my expectations with a shallow, repetitive loosely termed gameplay and a light story that didn't resonate before its long grind to its conclusion was over."},
    {title: "Overcooked",date: "24th Jan",duration: "7",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "Made for co-op play, though should come with a friendship warning as the frantic and finely tuned levels will put a test to any relationship to the test. The final boss especially was a great challenge, and even at 7 hours it didn't outstay its welcome, thanks to cooking mechanic and level design variety throughout."},
    {title: "Iconoclasts",date: "29th Jan",duration: "15.1",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "The game starts out strong with an intriguing plot, cast and gameplay premise but ultimately feels to drag its feet to its eventual conclusion. A just functional combat system, lack of variety in enemy encounters and slow progressing frequent occuring dialogue moments had its initial virtues become tired and repetitive before the credits roll."},
    {title: "NaissanceE",date: "29th Jan",duration: "3.2",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "Run, breath, run, breath, jump and occasionally stand still scratching your head wondering where to go next. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, and moments of pace where you utilize the games breathing mechanic but unfortunately the game gets bogged down too often with slower puzzle solving segments and often losses its direction with its obtuse world design."},
    {title: "Steamworld Dig 2",date: "29th Jan",duration: "9.9",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Ticks all the boxes for my obsessive compulsive personality, that happens to love filling progress bars and fulfilling objectives. There's some great comfort to be found in digging out mines of their treasures, and they've taken the formula from the first and built upon it to expand the world, the story and the various game systems to round out the game nicely."},
    {title: "Celeste",date: "1st Feb",duration: "8.1",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "Charming story, beautiful presentation and stunning platformer through and through. The rapid pace of the games failure to retry gameplay loop allows for a high level of challenge with few of the frustrations that can come with it, that made climbing its mountains bliss from start to end. Only a month into the year and Celeste is sure to remain a highlight."},
    {title: "Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut",date: "3rd Feb",duration: "3.5",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A segmented room puzzler in a similar style to Portal but replacing portals with shapes of various colours and a gun with a pretty glove. A reasonable pace to the linear puzzle rooms coupled with an intriguing story that has a surprisingly well executed concluding payoff twist all come together for a worth."},
    {title: "Metro: Last Light Redux",date: "4th Feb",duration: "11.3",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Post apocalyptic Russian-set first person shooters seems to be an oddly popular game setting, however few manage to craft a world quite as richly smothering as the Metro series manages. Story and moment to moment gameplay falls a little short of 2033, but still work well to compliment the suffocating atmosphere for a unique FPS experience."},
    {title: "Remnants of Naezith",date: "10th Feb",duration: "6.6",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "As a fan of brutal quick to fail platformers and growing up playing in classic Worms roper clans, this platformer-on-a-rope scratches an itch I've been needing relief from for quite some time. It's certainly not going to be for everyone, or I expect even many, but its for me and it executes it's core gameplay loop so excellently."},
    {title: "Octogeddon",date: "11th Feb",duration: "4.5",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "References to 'from the guys that brought you the original Plants vs. Zombies' had me diving in without questions asked. Although it certainly posses the personality and charm of that game, it unfortunately lacks its gameplay elegance. Terribly repetitive before long and rogue-like elements to extend game length with grind had me wanting to tap out long before it was beat."},
    {title: "Rusty Lake Paradise",date: "12th Feb",duration: "6.4",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "I still don't quite know what I experienced with its quirky style and nonsensical storytelling. That comes with charm though, which is more than I can say for the general gameplay loop that focuses on repetitive simplistic puzzle solving throughout levels that themselves too are repeated with small changes each loop through. It all gets a little dull before long."},
    {title: "Shadow of the Colossus",date: "12th Feb",duration: "4.7",platform: "PS4",rating: "5",review: "An extraordinary simple and straightforward game on paper that is pulled together with colossal grandeur, literally. I've a weak spot for games that leave you with memorable moments long after you've put them down, and Shadow of the Colossus gives them out in spades. A stunning experience through and through."},
    {title: "Dandara",date: "13th Feb",duration: "5.4",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "An interesting premise that turned out to be surprisingly frustrating in execution, namely due to quirky controls that felt better suited to touch than a controller/mouse or otherwise. The further the game progresses the more weight that is put on responsive quick actions, which just puts further emphasis on the games shortcomings."},
    {title: "BLIK",date: "19th Feb",duration: "4.2",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "A game bred somewhere between Talos and Portal, without the elegance of their puzzle design, lacking the charm or intriguing plot beats and a quirky latency to the control and inconsistency to the gameplay execution that leaves it somewhat as the unwanted child that's better off forgotten altogether."},
    {title: "A Case of Distrust",date: "21st Feb",duration: "4.5",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Fantastic visual style and jazz filled audio presentation backed by strong narration and an intriguing detective plot premise. Unfortunately the game falls short of landing the detective gameplay I sought, with a reasonably linear and simplistic approach to crime solving that leaves little fulfillment in its conclusion."},
    {title: "Into the Breach",date: "28th Feb",duration: "6.9",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Incredibly slick turn-based tactical strategy game, with a brutally efficient balance and rogue-like elements that are designed for long term replayability in-mind. Unfortunately I'm more of a one and done kind of player, so once I quickly beat the campaign I had little incentive to continue playing, though I still appreciate the stellar offerings at hand here and enjoyed my time with it."},
    {title: "Final Fantasy XV",date: "17th Mar",duration: "33.2",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A strange one for sure, FFXV is a wild ride through many ups and downs in an overly bloated package that spanned many hours of gameplay that had me questioning my investment but with enough magic sprinkled throughout that kept me going and creative ambition that I can't help but admire. It falls short of its potential but I'm still glad I took part in the attempt."},
    {title: "Candleman: The Complete Journey",date: "18th Mar",duration: "5.6",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Simple premise playing as a candle that can light his way at the cost of his life, needing to juggle vision in bursts whilst navigating various puzzles that utilize the boughts of darknes well. The shortcomings come with the slow plodding pace of the platforming and ultimately lack of challenge throughout the games many levels."},
    {title: "CHUCHEL",date: "9th Apr",duration: "3.1",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "I've historically enjoyed games from Amanita Design, however this time around I found CHUCHEL to lack the intriguing world and story I've come to expect. In its place are mostly plain scenes with isolated puzzles that are less logical in nature which too commonly can be brute forced by random clicking."},
    {title: "Q.U.B.E. 2",date: "10th Apr",duration: "5.4",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Brighter and more beautiful than its predecessor and although there's additional variety and complexity to the puzzle design I ultimately found them to become cumbersome before long and had a lot less intrigue in the narrative compared to that of the original. Still very much an enjoyable puzzler but not the superior successor I was anticipating."},
    {title: "SOMA",date: "29th Apr",duration: "6.7",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Stunning world building and atmospheric dread as I've come to expect from Frictional Games, though awkward enemy encounters and an incredibly slow pace makes the game a slog to get through at times. Those that immerse and stick with the game are rewarded handsomely though, with a conclusion that'll leave a dose of existential dread long after its over."},
    {title: "Beat Saber",date: "1st Jun",duration: "10",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "Whilst VR continues to mature I've often found myself awestruck by immersive worlds and realistic scenes that are unfortunately paired with weak gameplay and little in the way of replayability. Beat Saber is the opposite of this. It's my go to demonstration for newcomers to VR on the gameplay potential the platform has whilst being incredibly simple with spades of replayability."},
    {title: "Undertale",date: "10th Jun",duration: "12",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Undertale has long haunted my backlog, and whilst the repetition in the random encounters and generally slow pace to the game had me struggling to remain engaged the clever story premise and the charming characters that inhabit the world saw me through the game twice twice, once for the typical ending (I'm a monster) and also the true ending. In this world, it's kill or be killed."},
    {title: "Job Simulator",date: "15th Jun",duration: "4",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "A charming simplistic VR experience in which you tongue-in-cheek work your way through a handful of jobs, fulfilling the needs of corporate robot-kind. A little on the bare-bones side and repetitive before long, but a great initial VR experience and a good demonstration of both immersion and control for those new to VR."},
    {title: "Superhot VR",date: "15th Jun",duration: "2",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "SUPERHOT was the most innovative shooter I've played in years, and that was true before I played the VR version. The game was made for VR through and through, and they did a stunning job of translating the levels and charm of the original experience to fit brilliantly with VRs limited control capabilities. One of the best VR experiences available."},
    {title: "Subnautica",date: "2nd Jul",duration: "30",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "Subnautica took my by surprise, initially embarking on the sea water adventure with little expectations and quickly becoming consumed as hours fly by. It could be summarized as an underwater Minecraft, but that'd do the game a disservice. The approach to vertical exploration had me wanting to progressively swim deeper to undercover more about the strange world from first getting my feet wet right through to the games deepest darkest secrets."},
    {title: "Darkness Rises",date: "9th Jul",duration: "50",platform: "Mobile",rating: "1",review: "Straddling the line between a mobile MMO, gacha and linear action game, Darkness Rises has heaps of potential. A well balanced multi-character approach to progression coupled with gacha familiar energy systems had my engagement until it became all too apparent this was a Nexon game, and advertisements and monitization runs rampant smothering my every interaction with the games end-game."},
    {title: "World of Warcraft: Legion",date: "1st Aug",duration: "15",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "In preparation for Battle for Azeroth on the horizon I brought my Monk character through the Legion expansion ready at the level cap, and never actually used him afterwards. I see Legion as one of the better World of Warcraft expansions, even if it does go off the deep end with the alien lore in post release content patches."},
    {title: "Cities: Skylines",date: "8th Aug",duration: "11",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A sick wife sought a simulation game to keep her distracted to which Cities: Skylines seemed the most commonly suggested option. After a few hours of watching from the sidelines I started playing myself and got swept away. A fantastic fully featured city simulation with an impressive array of depth and complexity behind an accessible approachable learning curve."},
    {title: "Holedown",date: "10th Aug",duration: "3",platform: "Mobile",rating: "3",review: "A simplistic mobile action puzzler that has you needing to break platforms, Breakout style, as you progress through levels vertically. The simplistic gameplay has a surprising amount of replayability and charm to it, and levels are concluded before it overstays its welcome at around the 3 hour mark."},
    {title: "Pocket City",date: "10th Aug",duration: "5",platform: "Mobile",rating: "3",review: "A simplistic approach to typically complex city simulation games. Perfectly tailored to a mobile experience with just enough progressive systems and city expansion to fulfill it's five hours of game length. A worthwhile introduction to the genre for newcomers and a friendly bite-sized mobile experience for those familiar."},
    {title: "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth",date: "15th Aug",duration: "40",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "No matter how many years pass I still always get the itch every new expansion, and this time was no different. Twenty hours went by within two days before hitting the level cap, and the leveling experience whilst not without its flaws is arguably the most refined this time around. Unfortunately it wasn't long after clearing the available raid that I churned, likely until the next expansion rolls around."},
    {title: "No One Lives Forever",date: "3rd Sep",duration: "13",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A potential genre classic overlooked until a friend suggested the game for me. Technical hurdles aside the game has a cumbersome start but grows into a competent and feature packed, arguably ahead of its time, first person shooter that was a joy to conclude. Eager to play the sequel in the future to see if the games momentum continues further."},
    {title: "Destiny 2: Forsaken",date: "10th Sep",duration: "100",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Easily the best expansion for Destiny 2, feeling somewhat familiar in scope and impact to The Taken King expansion from Destiny 1. The core Destiny 2 experience now feels fully refined with a handful of quality of life improvements and there's a content breadth to keep you busy preparing for the new raid introduced, which itself is fantastic."},
    {title: "Two Point Hospital",date: "9th Nov",duration: "35",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Climbey/Dragon Cliff"},
    {title: "God of War (2018)",date: "10th Nov",duration: "20",platform: "PS4",rating: "5",review: ""},
    {title: "Spider-Man",date: "11th Nov",duration: "16",platform: "PS4",rating: "5",review: "The entire game package is well rounded from it's story through to its combat, and when all else fails swinging from the rooftops and traversing New York from the skies will never get old. It also feels both surprising and great to consider the characters and overall story premise of this game to be on par, if not better, than what the films have achieved."},
    {title: "Return of the Obra Dinn",date: "19th Nov",duration: "8.5",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "The game came out of nowhere and absolutely floored me. I had little idea what to expect going into this highly praised indie title, and was instantly hooked as the unique detective plot and gameplay loop began to unravel before me. Struggling to put the game down once I started, uncovering all the games secrets was a joy from start to finish. The prefect length, depth and complexity has the game as one of the most satisfying of the year."},
    {title: "Human: Fall Flat",date: "24th Nov",duration: "5",platform: "Switch",rating: "3",review: "Absolutely stunning graphically and in audio, unfortunately held back by the piecemeal short stories approach. Less than two hours for each is far too short to introduce, develop and attempt to land impactful conclusions for a handful of characters in complex scenarios. It's a shame too as each demonstrates potential, especially so with the Tirailleur War Story."},
    {title: "Battlefield V",date: "20th Nov",duration: "5",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "I'll always have a soft spot for platformers growing up in the 16-bit era, and I've always found an endless charm in physics systems in games. So when you pair the two together you get a surprisingly enjoyable yet challenging platformer that works exceptionally well in co-op, even if played with a troublesome 8 year old that seeks only to throw you off ledges."},
