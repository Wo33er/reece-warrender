    {title: "Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube",date: "4th Jan",duration: "12",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Accidently bought the wrong game, intending to get 'Q.U.B.E.' (they even look alike). Whilst I enjoyed the puzzle premise it unfortunately all becomes a little repetitive and drawn out before long, and a little too easy to offer any real sense of challenge or accomplishment for a puzzle game of its kind."},
    {title: "Snipperclips",date: "6th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "A surprisingly charming cute character cutting puzzler that works especially well in co-op, though prepare to be cut to bits constantly if you choose to play with a maniac child like I did. Well worth the affordable price tag and a well tailored first experience for the Switch perfect in short bursts or on the go."},
    {title: "Doki Doki Literature Club!",date: "12th Jan",duration: "4.2",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "There's not a great deal that can be said without spoiling the games primary hook, though it's safe to say that the experience begins with a content trigger warning and quickly extends far beyond its presented bounds. An enjoyable if wildly strange visual novel that attempts something unique and sticks the landing."},
    {title: "Hitman (2016)",date: "13th Jan",duration: "8.1",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "The reboot executes on its stealth sandbox approach so very successfully. Levels are intricate labyrinths of options and approaches, allowing you to truly feel like you're the assassin executing the play by play with the flexibility and freedom that should be afforded to you. Sad I missed the episodic releases but glad I gave the series another chance after Absolution left such a sour taste."},
    {title: "Tomb Raider (2013)",date: "14th Jan",duration: "12.1",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Take a dash of Uncharted, loosen the set pieces a little and add a smattering of torture porn by throwing Lara off an unreasonble amount of cliff edges and you've got a surprisingly well executed reboot to the Tomb Raider series. There's ample room for improvement but there's potential for something special, so I'm hopeful in future instalments to come."},
    {title: "Oxenfree",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5.9",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "The game starts off with an intriguing premise but ultimately lost my interest around the half way mark due to the snail's pace at which the game proceeds, not aided by lengthy slow plodding world backtracking, whilst the story and character development never quite achieves the payoff it attempts to build itself upto."},
    {title: "Hidden Folks",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "A black and white Where's Wally/Waldo (depending where you come from), with an array of hidden object challenges to find in highly populated backgrounds. Fun enough, though a little repetitive before long and a good portion of the challenges aren't clear between the brief descriptions and the similar shared styles."},
    {title: "The Red Strings Club",date: "23rd Jan",duration: "3.8",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "An overwhelmingly stylish and elegantly put together cyberpunk adventure game though a little on the short side at around four hours long. Especially enjoyed the bartending segments, which creatively mix up the games otherwise linear adventure segments. I strangely want to play a straight bartending simulation game now."},
    {title: "Little Inferno",date: "24th Jan",duration: "3.1",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "Initially had high hopes between being well praised in reviews and from half of the team behind World of Goo, however I found that the game fell short of my expectations with a shallow repetitive loosely termed gameplay and a light story that didn't resonate before its long grind to its conclusion was over."},
    {title: "Overcooked",date: "24th Jan",duration: "7",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "Made for co-op play, though should come with a friendship warning as the frantic and finely tuned levels will put a test to any relationship to the test. The final boss especially was a great challenge, and even at 7 hours it didn't outstay its welcome thanks to cooking mechanic and level design variety throughout."},
    {title: "Iconoclasts",date: "29th Jan",duration: "15.1",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "The game starts out strong with an intriguing plot, cast and gameplay premise but ultimately feels to drag its feet to its eventual conclusion. A just functional combat system, lack of variety in enemy encounters and slow progressing frequent occuring dialogue moments had its initial virtues become tired and repetitive before the credits roll."},
    {title: "NaissanceE",date: "29th Jan",duration: "3.2",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "Run, breath, run, breath, jump and occassionally stand still stratching your head wondering where to go next. I really enjoyed the asthetic of the game, and moments of pace where you utilize the games breathing mechanic but unfortunately the game gets bogged down too often with slower puzzle solving segments and often losses its direction with its obtuse world design."},
    {title: "Steamworld Dig 2",date: "29th Jan",duration: "9.9",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Ticks all the boxes for my obsessive compulse personality, that happens to love filling progress bars and fulfilling objectives. There's some great comfort to be found in digging out mines of their treasures, and they've taken the formula from the first and built upon it to expand the world, the story and the various game systems to round out the game nicely."},
    {title: "Celeste",date: "1st Feb",duration: "8.1",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "Charming story, beautiful presentation and stunning platformer through and through. The rapid pace of the games failure to retry gameplay loop allows for a high level of challenge with few of the frustrations that can come with it, that made climbing its mountains bliss from start to end. Only a month into the year and Celeste is sure to remain a highlight."},
    {title: "Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut",date: "3rd Feb",duration: "3.5",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A segmented room puzzler in a similar style to Portal but replacing portals with shapes of various colours and a gun with a pretty glove. A reasonable pace to the linear puzzle rooms coupled with an intriguing story that has a surprisingly well executed concluding payoff twist all come together for a worth."},
    {title: "Metro: Last Light Redux",date: "4th Feb",duration: "11.3",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Post apolocyptic Russian-set first person shooters seems to be an oddly popular game setting, however few manage to craft a world quite as richly smothering as the Metro series manages. Story and moment to moment gameplay falls a little short of 2033, but still work well to compliment the suffocating atmosphere for a unique FPS experience."},
    {title: "Remnants of Naezith",date: "10th Feb",duration: "6.6",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "As a fan of brutal quick to fail platformers and growing up playing in classic Worms roper clans, this platformer-on-a-rope scratches an itch I've been needing relief from for quite some time. It's certainly not going to be for everyone, or I expect even many, but its for me and it executes it's core gameplay loop so excellently."},
    {title: "Octogeddon",date: "11th Feb",duration: "4.5",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "References to 'from the guys that brought you the original Plants vs. Zombies' had me diving in without questions asked. Although it certainly posses the personality and charm of that game, it unfortunately lacks its gameplay elegance. Terribly repetitive before long and rogue-like elements to extend game length with grind had me wanting to tap out long before it was beat."},
    {title: "Rusty Lake Paradise",date: "12th Feb",duration: "6.4",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "I still don't quite know what I experienced with its quirky style and nonsensical storytelling. That comes with charm though, which is more than I can say for the general gameplay loop that focuses on repetitive simplistic puzzle solving throughout levels that themselves too are repeated with small changes each loop through. It all gets a little dull before long."},
    {title: "Shadow of the Colossus",date: "12th Feb",duration: "4.7",platform: "PS4",rating: "5",review: "An extraordinary simple and straightforward game on paper that is pulled together with collosal grandeur, literally. I've a weak spot for games that leave you with memorable moments long after you've put them down, and Shadow of the Colossus gives them out in spades. A stunning experience through and through."},
    {title: "Dandara",date: "13th Feb",duration: "5.4",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "An interesting premise that turned out to be surprisingly frustrating in execution, namely due to quirky controls that felt better suited to touch than a controller/mouse or otherwise. The further the game progresses the more weight that is put on responsive quick actions, which just puts further emphasis on the games shortcomings."},
    {title: "BLIK",date: "19th Feb",duration: "4.2",platform: "PC",rating: "2",review: "A game bred somewhere between Talos and Portal, without the elegance of their puzzle design, lacking the charm or intriguing plot beats and a quirky latency to the control and inconsistency to the gameplay execution that leaves it somewhat as the unwanted child that's better off forgotten altogether."},
    {title: "A Case of Distrust",date: "21st Feb",duration: "4.5",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Fantastic visual style and jazz filled audio presentation backed by strong narration and an intriguing detective plot premise. Unfortunately the game falls short of landing the detective gameplay I sought, with a reasonably linear and simplistic approach to crime solving that leaves little fulfilment in its conclusion."},
    {title: "Into the Breach",date: "28th Feb",duration: "6.9",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Increadibly slick turn-based tactical strategy game, with a brutally efficient balance and rogue-like elements that are designed for long term replayability in-mind. Unfortunately I'm more of a one and done kind of player, so once I quickly beat the campaign I had little incentive to continue playing, though I still appreciate the stellar offerings at hand here and enjoyed my time with it."},
    {title: "Final Fantasy XV",date: "17th Mar",duration: "33.2",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "A strange one for sure, FFXV is a wild ride through many ups and downs in an overly bloated package that spanned many hours of gameplay that had me questioning my investment but with enough magic sprinkled throughout that kept me going and creative ambition that I can't help but admire. It falls short of its potential but I'm still glad I took part in the attempt."},
