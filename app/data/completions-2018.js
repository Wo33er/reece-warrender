    {title: "Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube",date: "4th Jan",duration: "12",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "Accidently bought the wrong game, intending to get 'Q.U.B.E.' (they even look alike). Whilst I enjoyed the puzzle premise it unfortunately all becomes a little repetitive and drawn out before long, and a little too easy to offer any real sense of challenge or accomplishment for a puzzle game of its kind."},
    {title: "Snipperclips",date: "6th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "A surprisingly charming cute character cutting puzzler that works especially well in co-op, though prepare to be cut to bits constantly if you choose to play with a maniac child like I did. Well worth the affordable price tag and a well tailored first experience for the Switch perfect in short bursts or on the go."},
    {title: "Doki Doki Literature Club!",date: "12th Jan",duration: "4.2",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "There's not a great deal that can be said without spoiling the games primary hook, though it's safe to say that the experience begins with a content trigger warning and quickly extends far beyond its presented bounds. An enjoyable if wildly strange visual novel that attempts something unique and sticks the landing."},
    {title: "Hitman (2016)",date: "13th Jan",duration: "8.1",platform: "PC",rating: "5",review: "The reboot executes on its stealth sandbox approach so very successfully. Levels are intricate labyrinths of options and approaches, allowing you to truly feel like you're the assassin executing the play by play with the flexibility and freedom that should be afforded to you. Sad I missed the episodic releases but glad I gave the series another chance after Absolution left such a sour taste."},
    {title: "Tomb Raider (2013)",date: "14th Jan",duration: "12.1",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "Take a dash of Uncharted, loosen the set pieces a little and add a smattering of torture porn by throwing Lara off an unreasonble amount of cliff edges and you've got a surprisingly well executed reboot to the Tomb Raider series. There's ample room for improvement but there's potential for something special, so I'm hopeful in future instalments to come."},
    {title: "Oxenfree",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5.9",platform: "PC",rating: "3",review: "The game starts off with an intriguing premise but ultimately lost my interest around the half way mark due to the snail's pace at which the game proceeds, not aided by lengthy slow plodding world backtracking, whilst the story and character development never quite achieves the payoff it attempts to build itself upto."},
    {title: "Hidden Folks",date: "16th Jan",duration: "5",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "A black and white Where's Wally/Waldo (depending where you come from), with an array of hidden object challenges to find in highly populated backgrounds. Fun enough, though a little repetitive before long and a good portion of the challenges aren't clear between the brief descriptions and the similar shared styles."},
    {title: "The Red Strings Club",date: "23rd Jan",duration: "3.8",platform: "PC",rating: "4",review: "An overwhelmingly stylish and elegantly put together cyberpunk adventure game though a little on the short side at around four hours long. Especially enjoyed the bartending segments, which creatively mix up the games otherwise linear adventure segments. I strangely want to play a straight bartending simulation game now."},
    {title: "Little Inferno",date: "24th Jan",duration: "3.1",platform: "Mobile",rating: "2",review: "Initially had high hopes between being well praised in reviews and from half of the team behind World of Goo, however I found that the game fell short of my expectations with a shallow repetitive loosely termed gameplay and a light story that didn't resonate before its long grind to its conclusion was over."},
    {title: "Overcooked",date: "24th Jan",duration: "7",platform: "Switch",rating: "4",review: "Made for co-op play, though should come with a friendship warning as the frantic and finely tuned levels will put a test to any relationship to the test. The final boss especially was a great challenge, and even at 7 hours it didn't outstay its welcome thanks to cooking mechanic and level design variety throughout."},
